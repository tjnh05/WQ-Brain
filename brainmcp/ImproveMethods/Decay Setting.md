The Decay function in the Alpha settings block is a linear decay function over a period of n days where the value on day "t" is equal to the weighted average of the values from day "t" to day "t-n". 

What exactly does this do to the alpha? Does this linear decay function change all input data being used in the alpha? So the actual values are not being used, but rather every input value is changed to a weighted average? In this case, why is the default decay set to 4?
