Here are five tips that may help you improve the returns of your alphas:

Increase the turnover of your alphas — higher turnover means more trading and potentially higher returns.
Use lower decay values in the alpha settings.
Work on more liquid (smaller) universes in the alpha settings.
While keeping returns and drawdown at the same level, you may get higher returns if you increase the volatility of your alphas.
Try using news and analyst datasets. They may have the potential to generate alphas with good returns.
