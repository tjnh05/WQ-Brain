This is a common problem many researchers face in their alpha research — you are not alone. Test different variations of your Alpha expression using:


Different data fields: You might try to use an equivalent data field first (such as “high,” “low” or “open” to replace “close”).
Different operators: Again start with something you find similar in practice, building your own library of similarity that could further help you reduce max correlation. E.g. median instead of mean, zscore instead of rank etc.
Different groupings and neutralizations: This is powerful approach, but don’t create an arbitrary group just for the sake of reducing correlation.
Think outside of the box: This is the best way and true research
