Often there is no best answer for this general question, so we would suggest you first need to understand the Sharpe or the related metric, information ratio (IR).

IR = Return / standard_deviation (Return)

Based on this formula, there are two ways to improve IR:

Increase your Alpha return.
Reduce your volatility. E.g. by using neutralization settings and grouping operators
 

Quick Pointers

Don’t unnecessarily try to improve the Sharpe of your alpha by simply adjusting the parameters. Your alphas should make logical sense from both a mathematical and economic perspective.
Focus more on returns after achieving the minimum Sharpe and fitness thresholds. Sharpe and fitness thresholds exist to differentiate alpha signals from noise and, therefore, when you achieve the appropriate thresholds, it is better to concentrate on the simulated returns, making that your focal point.
The more you work on BRAIN, the more you will gain techniques to improve your signals — nothing can replace hard work. For the beginner, we suggest you spend time on the Learn section of the Brain platform and on the Community forum where you can get insights from other experienced researchers.
